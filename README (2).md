# FBLA summer

This Website was created for individuals who want to join a FBLA event through west-mec

#Navigation

There are 3 navigation items, West-mec FBLA summer - which puts you to the Home Page, Events - which takes you to Events - and then Contact - Which takes you to a form you can input information in. 

#Home
The Home Page features 2 buttons, that try to get users to engage with the app by either taking them quickly to the Contacts to fill out their information, or to Events if they want to check it out (which ultimately also leads them into contacts)

#Events
The Events page features many events, although not all, and it has a left and right arrow in a carousel format to engage the users. Furthermore, it also names each carousel card, and below each carousel card is a button you have to hover over to see, which also leads you to the Contacts page.

#Contacts
This is the end goal page, where it asks the user for their information, and then once you click submit it is responsive. By this, there is a alert call that thanks the user for his submission, with the addition of their names.

#How to run the Website Locally
There are many ways to run the website locally, the best way is to download my code, extract the zip code and click on the index.com file.

However, if you have VS code installed you can download the extension Live Server, to run the server live and get feedback in real time. 


#Challenges
I was really rusty on Javascript, especially because it is the language I don't have the basics to yet. This, was a big issue because I was trying to create a carousel. Carousels usaully require a good amount of javascript knowledge, so I had to go out of my way and learn how to make the images move. This was done through a thorough youtube video.
